# About React

This repository is my personal playground for learning React, built on top of a minimal Vite + React setup.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Scripts
- npm run dev – start development server
- npm run build – build for production
- npm run preview – preview production build
- npm run lint – run ESLint checks
